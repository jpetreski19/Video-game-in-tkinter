Product type: Tkinter game
A short description of the game: you are playing as a shark
in a very polluted ocean (with lots of cans and plastic bags)
Your task is to survive as long as possible (that is without
eating any of the unwanted objects) and possibli eat as many
fish as possible (so that your score increases). At the
beginning, you are displayed 4 menus: start new game, load
last saved game, leaderboard and quit. You can also save your
current game but be aware that this deletes the previous saved
game. If you are in the top 5 players, your name will be
displayed in the leaderboard. There are 3 cheat codes: nodeath
(you can lose the game), double (the score for each fish eaten
is now twice than normally) and noobject (only fish will be
created for you and the ocean suddenly becomes very clear :).
You can pause and unpause the game only when in gameplay mode and
you have a boss key at your disposal all the time.

A hit is detected only if it is the mouth area of the shark (since
sharks are not that flexible).
Also, the game was little bit laggy when I tested last time on a lab machine
but it runs very smoothly on my personal laptop. This may be due to the number of objects
created and the resolution of the images (probably the graphics card is not that powerful).

Enter (return) - boss key is displayed
nodeath (typed with no spaces) - first cheat code so that the player cannot loose the game
double - for each eaten fish you get double the score for it (20 instead of 10)
noobject - unwanted objects stop to appear and the chance of fish being displayed is increased
arrows - to control the main object
exit (typed with no spaces) - to terminate the game
Escape - to pause and unpause the game
Left click on mouse - used to toggle menus and navigate through the menu pages
